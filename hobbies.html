            <h3>Tennis</h3>
            <p> 
                I have inconsistently played tennis for 3 years in high school 
                in junior varsity. I would rate myself as being average at best
                because I can somewhat execute forehand swings and my footwork is alright.

            <h3>Video Games</h3>
            <p>
                Video games have always been something I've enjoyed for as long as I've known. 
                I've played games on the PS3, Xbox, and Game Cube to name a few. My favorite type
                of game is single player games. Some of my favorites are Jet Set Radio Future and LoZ: The Wind Waker.
                A few of my favorite multiplayer games are Apex Legends and Realm of the Mad God.

            <h3>Bouldering</h3>
            <p>
                I've only gone bouldering a few times, but each time I went, I had a lot of fun. I would go 
                bouldering more often if I didn't have to ask someone for a ride each time I go. Additionally,
                gym memberships are quite expensive.
